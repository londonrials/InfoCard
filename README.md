## ðŸ’• InfoCard
### About
InfoCard is extremely simple, it's a Linktree/link-in-bio type of website. Just something for me (or anyone else) to just have to display social media links on.

### About
I don't care what you do with this or it's code as long as you follow the license attached with the files! It's not there for no damn reason now. I'm not providing support for this as it's literally just middle school level HTML and CSS, so do what you want with it. Honestly it's only public because I'm using Github Pages.
